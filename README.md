# Machine-Learning-Project-Name-Loan-Status-Prediction
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the status of a loan application (Approved or Rejected) based on applicant information and financial history. It demonstrates the full workflow of a typical ML project — from data preprocessing and exploration to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

🚀 Features
Clean and preprocess real-world loan data

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights

Implementation of various ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

Optional: Deployment via a web interface using Flask or Streamlit

🧠 Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub for version control
